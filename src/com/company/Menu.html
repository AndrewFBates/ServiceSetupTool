    <h3>Main Menu Info</h3>
    <p>From the main menu you can choose to go into service setup, or service monitoring mode. To use service monitoring
        mode, you will need to install Wireshark from <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Service Setup</h3>
    <p>This mode does not automate service setup, it just provides information (available by clicking the info button or
    by clicking <a href="NetworkTraffic.html">this</a>.) about network traffic, port-forwarding, and connections, then
    tests the connectivity of the user’s service. </p>
    <h3>Monitoring Mode </h3>
    <p>This mode uses the service’s port and IP to generate some Wireshark filters. The user can then only show traffic
        to and from that service. If Wireshark is installed, you maybe able to open it from within the service setup
        tool. More information is available about Wireshark <a href="Wireshark.html">here</a> </p>
