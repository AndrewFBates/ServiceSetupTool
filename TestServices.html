    <h3>Service Connectivity Test </h3>
<p>This service setup tool uses the Powershell command <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/nettcpip/test-netconnection?view=win10-ps">Test-NetConnection</a>.
    This command attempts to create a full TCP
    connection to the target IP (your global IP address in this case) and port. If successful, it  shows that your
    service is available to connect to via the internet. If your service is using UDP, the connection will fail. To get
    around this, a second test is done after your local machine creates a TCP port on the same port as your service.
    Assuming both UDP and TCP ports are forwarded, this test will work. The Test-NetConnection command can also provide
    additional information (such as if the target responds to pings, or your source interface.) </p>
