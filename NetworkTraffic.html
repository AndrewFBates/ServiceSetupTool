    <h3>Network Traffic Overview</h3>
    <p>All internet traffic has a source and destination, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">and Internet
        Protocol (IP)</a> is how computers keep track of senders and receivers. Every device needs a unique address in
        order to receive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet">packets</a> (data at the network
        level). However because IPv4 address are limited, often whole networks share 1 IP address that the outside world
        can communicate with (your global IP address). Within these networks each computer still has a unique address
        (your local IP address). To communicate to the outside world, your router (which is also your default gatewayâ€™s
        IP address) uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">Network Address Translation
            (NAT)</a>. Nat Overload keeps track of connections via port, and hides your local computer from the outside
        world. If someone wants to start a connection to your machine, your router must allow it through
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding">port-forwarding</a>. Port-forwarding takes incoming
        traffic, and sends it to your local machine based on the destination port. Potentially, someone can exploit this
        to get onto your network, so it is recommended you only leave port-forwarding on when you are using it. You can
        find your router's default login and password <a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/default-router-username-and-password-list/">here</a></p>
    <p>To Setup port-forwarding, add a rule to yor portfowarding list that should look something like this:</p>
    <p>External IP 0.0.0.0 (any external IP address) Port (whatever port your service uses) to Internal IP (whatever
        your local machine's IP is) Port (whatever port your service uses) Protocol UDP and TCP, enabled</p>
