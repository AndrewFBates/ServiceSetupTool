    <h3>Welcome to the Service Setup Guide</h3>
    <p>The Service Setup Tool is a Java application designed to work without needing to install additional software. It
        uses a GUI and is compatible with Windows machines. While rather simple in design, it is intended for use by
        people with little to no experience hosting over the internet services or games.</p>
